Experience
======
* **Research Assistant**, Intelligent Autonomous Systems Lab (IASL), The George Washington University, Washington DC, USA *(Sep 2024 – Present)*  
  - Developed a decentralized-centralized training, decentralized execution **multi-agent reinforcement learning** framework using attention mechanisms for safe separation of heterogeneous sUAS fleets (NASA-funded project; under preparation for ITSC 2026).  
  - Designed a novel **attention-based neuro-symbolic differentiable rule extractor (ANDRE)** capable of learning logical rules in continuous rule spaces via attention-based conjunction/disjunction operators and curriculum learning (under review at AAAI 2025).  

* **Visiting Researcher**, Connected and Automated Vehicles Lab (CAV-Lab), University of Surrey, Guildford, UK *(Jan 2023 – Dec 2023)*  
  - Developed a **safe neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning** framework for autonomous driving systems, published in *Transportation Research Record (TRR)*.  
  - Proposed a **symbolic imitation learning** framework using inductive logic programming to extract human-like behavioral rules in highway driving (under review at *Applied Sciences*).  

* **Research Assistant**, Control Lab, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran *(Sep 2019 – Mar 2022)*  
  - Developed a **self-tuning PID controller** using hybrid actor-critic neural networks for quadcopters (published at ISME 2022).  

* **Teaching Assistant**, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran *(Sep 2019 – Mar 2022)*  
  - Assisted in graduate courses: *Fuzzy Systems & Control*, *Advanced Applied Mathematics*  
  - Assisted in undergraduate courses: *Automatic Control*, *Differential Equations*
