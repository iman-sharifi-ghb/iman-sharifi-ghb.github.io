I am a **Ph.D. student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering** at **The George Washington University**, where I work with [Prof. Peng Wei](https://faculty.engineering.gwu.edu/peng-wei) in the **Intelligent Autonomous Systems Lab (IASL)**.  
My research lies at the intersection of **Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence**, **Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**, and **Autonomous Systems**. I am broadly interested in developing **interpretable and verifiable AI systems** for safety-critical applications such as **airspace management**, **advanced air mobility (AAM)**, and **autonomous driving**.

I have also conducted research as a **Visiting Researcher** at the **Connected and Automated Vehicles Lab (CAV-Lab)**, University of Surrey, focusing on symbolic imitation learning and safe decision-making for autonomous vehicles.  
My work has been funded by **NASA** under the **University Leadership Initiative (ULI)** and published in venues such as *Transportation Research Record (TRR)*, *IJCAI*, and under review at *AAAI*.
