I presented a poster titled *"sUAS Separation Assurance with Mixed Aircraft Equipage and Heterogeneous Tactical Deconfliction Policies"* at the **NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI) Workshop** held at **Vanderbilt University**, Nashville, Tennessee, USA, on **October 16, 2025**.  

This workshop brought together multiple research teams and industrial partners collaborating under NASAâ€™s ULI program, including **The George Washington University**, **Vanderbilt University**, **Tennessee State University**, **The University of Texas at Austin**, **Purdue University**, **UC Irvine**, and **Collins Aerospace**.  

The presented work focused on a **multi-agent reinforcement learning framework** for ensuring safe separation among heterogeneous small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) operating in shared airspace environments.
