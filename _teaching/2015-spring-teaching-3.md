I served as a **Teaching Assistant** for the undergraduate course **Automatic Control** at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, **Sharif University of Technology**.  

My main contributions included:

The course focused on fundamental control theory concepts such as transfer functions, stability analysis, and PID control design.
