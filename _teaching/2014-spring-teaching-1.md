I served as a **Teaching Assistant** for the graduate course **Fuzzy Systems & Control** at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, **Sharif University of Technology**.  

My responsibilities included:
- Assisting the instructor with course materials and problem sessions  
- Designing and grading homework and midterm assignments  
- Supporting student projects related to fuzzy control system design  

This course introduced fuzzy logic principles and their applications in control engineering, including rule-based reasoning and fuzzy inference systems.
